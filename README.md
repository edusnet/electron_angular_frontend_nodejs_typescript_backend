# Sample project for VSCode for electron with angular in frontend and nodejs and typescript in backend. 
This project is intended to help to start a project with electron, using angular in the renderer process for the user interface, and node JS with typescript for the backend functionality.

The project is ready to debug the Frontend (renderer process) and the Backend (main process).

Also includes a script for generating a "compiled" .exe for windows. 

I think the electron is a great idea. I especially appreciate the idea of developing an application packaged in an exe and, in the future, deploying it to a web server with just a few code changes, so if you rewrite the IPC communication code to a common web http request, you can deploy it easily on a web server.  


I've spend a few days setting up the environment, so I hope it saves sometime to anybody. 

I suppose if you use this project you have the background to install NodeJs, chrome debugger plugin, etc on you computer and install npm packages for running a downloaded project, buy let me know if you need some help or comments.
